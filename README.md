# Multi-level Converter Optimization

This folder stores the Modular Multilevel Converter design optimization code used in the IEEE journal https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9023972. This journal paper is open sourced and free to download from IEEE site.

This MATLAB design code optimizes the MMC using a population based optimization engine. In this code, we use MATLAB based Genetic Algorithm Toolbox GOSET, developed by Dr. Scott Sudhoff at Purdue University, and is available for download for free at https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/Research/Areas/PES/Software/genetic-optimization-toolbox-2.6.

This code was written ~4 years ago, and is no longer maintained. I am uploading this code on Github for educational purpuses only.
